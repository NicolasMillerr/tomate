# Tomate

What is tomate? A pomodoro timer that can sit in a terminal window. It has a minimal feature set.
This isn't meant to be a particularly fancy tool. It allows you to:
- Start a 25 minute timer, shortcut 's w' -> start work
- Start a 5 minute timer, shortcut 's b' -> start break

While a timer is running, you can:
- Pause the timer
- Resume the timer
- Reset the timer

You do this by using specified keystrokes:
- Press 'p' to pause the timer
- Press 'r' to resume the timer
- Press 'x' twice to reset the timer
